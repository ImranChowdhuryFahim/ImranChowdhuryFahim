# Hi there, I'm Imran Chowdhury 👋

**Backend Engineer** specializing in scalable systems, distributed architectures, and AI-powered applications.

Currently building production systems at **FringeCore** that serve 150K+ users, with a focus on performance optimization, system reliability, and cutting-edge AI integration.

## 🚀 What I Do

I architect and build backend systems that scale. From real-time CDC pipelines processing 175GB+ databases to AI-powered news assistants using RAG architecture, I focus on creating robust solutions that solve real problems.

**Recent highlights:**
- Built **ekhon.tv** news platform from scratch (150K+ monthly users) with self-healing caching system
- Optimized database queries achieving **99.5% performance improvement** (18.9s → 100ms)
- Architected enterprise CDC pipeline using **Kafka + Debezium** for hospital database migration (400K+ patient records, zero downtime)
- Developed **LilyGPT**, an AI-powered Bangla news assistant using RAG, LangGraph, and ChromaDB
- Saved **40 lakh BDT** in hardware costs through infrastructure modernization and query optimization

## 🎓 Education

**BSc in Computer Science & Engineering** | CGPA: 3.65/4.00  
Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET) | 2018-2023

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Advanced distributed systems patterns
- AI/ML integration in production systems
- Real-time data streaming architectures
- Vector databases and semantic search optimization

## 💡 Philosophy

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that solves real problems. Performance optimization isn't just about speed—it's about creating systems that scale efficiently and degrade gracefully. Every line of code should serve a purpose, and every system should be built with reliability in mind.
